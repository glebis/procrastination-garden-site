The concept of procrastination has been recognized and discussed throughout human history, with various historical figures addressing its nature and consequences.

### Etymology

The word "procrastination" comes from the Latin "procrastinatus," which is derived from "pro-" (forward) and "crastinus" (of tomorrow). This etymology reflects the act of putting things off until a future time.

### Historical Perspectives

1. Ancient Greece (8th century BCE):
   Hesiod, a Greek poet from Ascra, Boeotia, warned against procrastination in his didactic poem "Works and Days" (c. 700 BCE):
   "Do not put your work off till tomorrow and the day after; for a sluggish worker does not fill his barn, nor one who puts off his work."
   This work, focused on agricultural life, emphasizes the importance of timely action in farming and daily life.

2. Ancient Rome (1st century BCE):
   Marcus Tullius Cicero, the Roman philosopher, statesman, and orator (106-43 BCE), born in Arpinum, Italy, described procrastination in his work "Philippics" (44 BCE):
   "In the conduct of almost every affair slowness and procrastination are hateful."
   Cicero's political career and writings often stressed the importance of timely action in governance and personal conduct.

3. Renaissance Italy (15th-16th century):
   Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), the polymath from Vinci, Italy, known for his numerous unfinished works including the "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," wrote in his notebooks (c. 1490):
   "It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end."
   Despite his genius, Leonardo's tendency to procrastinate and leave works unfinished was well-documented, with only about 15 of his paintings surviving to this day.

4. Enlightenment Era England (18th century):
   Dr. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), English writer, lexicographer, and creator of "A Dictionary of the English Language" (1755), observed in his periodical "The Rambler" (1751):
   "Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy."
   Johnson himself struggled with procrastination, famously completing his dictionary in 9 years instead of the projected 3 years.

5. Victorian Era England (19th century):
   Charles Dickens (1812-1870), born in Portsmouth, England, touched on procrastination in his semi-autobiographical novel "David Copperfield" (1850), through the character of Wilkins Micawber:
   "Procrastination is the thief of time, collar him."
   Dickens, known for his prolific output and strict writing schedule, often explored themes of personal responsibility and the consequences of inaction in his works.

6. Modern Era United States (20th century):
   William James (1842-1910), American philosopher and psychologist at Harvard University, wrote in his "Principles of Psychology" (1890):
   "Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task."
   James's work laid the foundation for modern psychological studies on habit formation and the will, influencing later research on procrastination.

These historical references spanning over 2,500 years demonstrate that procrastination has been a persistent human behavior throughout recorded history. Recognized across various cultures, eras, and disciplines - from agriculture to art, politics to psychology - procrastination has consistently been identified as a significant obstacle to productivity, personal growth, and societal progress.
