# Lack of Clarity as a Procrastination Trigger

Lack of clarity refers to situations where goals, instructions, or expectations are unclear or ambiguous. This ambiguity can lead to procrastination as individuals may feel unsure about how to proceed or what exactly is required of them.

## Why it triggers procrastination:
1. Uncertainty about what needs to be done
2. Difficulty in planning or prioritizing tasks
3. Fear of making mistakes due to misunderstanding
4. Feeling overwhelmed by the lack of direction

## Strategies to overcome:
1. Seek clarification from supervisors, colleagues, or instructors
2. Break down vague goals into specific, actionable steps
3. Use the SMART goal framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
4. Create a project outline or mind map to visualize the task and its components
5. Start with what you do understand and build from there
6. Regularly review and adjust your understanding as you progress

Remember, it's okay to ask for help or more information when faced with unclear tasks or goals. Clarity is essential for effective task completion and reducing procrastination.
