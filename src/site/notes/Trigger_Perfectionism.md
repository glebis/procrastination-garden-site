# Perfectionism as a Procrastination Trigger

Perfectionism refers to the tendency to set excessively high standards and to be overly critical of one's performance. When it comes to procrastination, perfectionism can be a significant trigger, causing individuals to delay starting or completing tasks due to fear of not meeting these unrealistic standards.

## Why it triggers procrastination:
1. Fear of failure or not meeting high standards
2. Anxiety about potential criticism or judgment
3. Overthinking and overplanning instead of taking action
4. All-or-nothing thinking that prevents starting unless conditions are "perfect"

## Strategies to overcome:
1. Set realistic and achievable goals
2. Practice self-compassion and acknowledge that mistakes are part of the learning process
3. Focus on progress rather than perfection
4. Use time-boxing techniques to limit the time spent on tasks
5. Challenge perfectionist thoughts with more balanced, realistic thinking
6. Start with a "good enough" draft and improve iteratively
7. Seek feedback early in the process rather than waiting for a "perfect" result

Remember, striving for excellence is admirable, but perfectionism can be paralyzing. Learning to balance high standards with realistic expectations is key to overcoming perfectionism-driven procrastination.
