# Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques

Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques are among the most effective interventions for procrastination. 


These techniques focus on identifying and modifying unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to procrastination. Cognitive restructuring involves challenging and changing negative thoughts, while implementation intentions are specific "if-then" plans for initiating tasks. Both strategies have shown significant effectiveness in reducing procrastination behaviors.
