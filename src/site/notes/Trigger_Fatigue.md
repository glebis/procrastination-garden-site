# Fatigue as a Procrastination Trigger

Fatigue refers to a state of physical or mental exhaustion that can significantly impact an individual's ability to initiate or complete tasks. When it comes to procrastination, fatigue can be a powerful trigger, causing individuals to delay or avoid tasks due to a lack of energy or mental clarity.

## Why it triggers procrastination:
1. Reduced cognitive capacity and decision-making ability
2. Decreased motivation and willpower
3. Increased desire for rest or low-effort activities
4. Difficulty in focusing or concentrating on tasks
5. Lowered frustration tolerance, making challenges seem more daunting
6. Impaired time perception, leading to poor task prioritization

## Types of fatigue:
1. Physical fatigue: Bodily exhaustion or weakness
2. Mental fatigue: Cognitive exhaustion, difficulty in thinking or concentrating
3. Emotional fatigue: Feeling overwhelmed or emotionally drained
4. Chronic fatigue: Persistent tiredness that isn't relieved by rest

## Strategies to overcome:
1. Improve sleep habits:
   - Maintain a consistent sleep schedule

7. Address underlying health issues:
