# Time Blocking

Time blocking is a time management strategy that involves scheduling specific time slots for tasks. This technique, popularized by productivity experts like Cal Newport and mentioned in Stephen Covey's work, can be an effective tool for combating procrastination.

## Key aspects of time blocking:

1. Allocate specific time periods for different tasks or types of work.
2. Create a visual schedule of your day or week.
3. Minimize context switching by grouping similar tasks together.
4. Include buffer time for unexpected tasks or breaks.

## Benefits for procrastination:

- Provides structure to your day, reducing decision fatigue.
- Creates a sense of urgency by assigning specific times to tasks.
- Helps in prioritizing important tasks by ensuring they get dedicated time.
- Reduces overwhelm by breaking the day into manageable chunks.

## Implementation tips:

1. Start by time blocking your most important or challenging tasks.
2. Be realistic about how long tasks will take.
3. Review and adjust your time blocks regularly.
4. Use digital tools or a physical planner to create and maintain your schedule.

Remember, the goal is to create a framework for your day, not to rigidly control every minute. Allow for flexibility while maintaining the overall structure.
