# SMART Goals

SMART Goals is a goal-setting framework that has been widely adopted in various fields, including procrastination management. As mentioned in the Research.md file:

> SMART Goals: Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals (Doran, 1981).

The SMART acronym stands for:

- Specific: Clear and well-defined
- Measurable: Quantifiable or able to be tracked
- Achievable: Realistic and attainable
- Relevant: Aligned with broader objectives
- Time-bound: Has a specific deadline or timeframe

Using SMART goals can be an effective strategy for overcoming procrastination by providing clarity, structure, and motivation.

Benefits of SMART goals for addressing procrastination:

1. Clarity: Specific goals reduce ambiguity and make it easier to start tasks.
2. Motivation: Measurable goals allow for tracking progress, which can boost motivation.
3. Confidence: Achievable goals build self-efficacy and reduce the fear of failure.
4. Focus: Relevant goals ensure effort is directed towards meaningful outcomes.
5. Urgency: Time-bound goals create a sense of deadline, reducing the tendency to delay.

Examples of SMART goals for combating procrastination:

- Non-SMART goal: "I'll start working on my project soon."
  SMART goal: "I will complete the first draft of my project report by next Friday, writing at least 500 words each day."

- Non-SMART goal: "I need to exercise more."
  SMART goal: "I will go for a 30-minute jog three times a week for the next month, starting this Monday."

- Non-SMART goal: "I should organize my workspace."
  SMART goal: "I will spend 20 minutes each evening this week decluttering one area of my desk, completing the entire desk by Friday."

Tips for using SMART goals to combat procrastination:

1. Break larger goals into smaller SMART sub-goals.
2. Write down your SMART goals and place them where you can see them regularly.
3. Review and adjust your goals as needed.
4. Celebrate achieving your SMART goals to reinforce positive behavior.
5. Use SMART goals in conjunction with other techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or implementation intentions.

By setting SMART goals, individuals can create a clear path forward, reducing uncertainty and increasing motivation, which are key factors in overcoming procrastination.
