## Types of group interventions:

4. Workshop-style interventions
5. Online forums and communities

## Implementing group interventions:

1. Find or create a group:
   - Look for existing groups in your community or online

2. Establish group norms and goals:
   - Set clear expectations for participation and confidentiality
   - Define the group's purpose and desired outcomes

3. Structure group sessions:

4. Encourage active participation:

5. Track progress:
   - Set individual and group goals
   - Regularly review and celebrate achievements

## Potential challenges:
