# Reward Systems

Establishing reward systems can be an effective strategy for combating procrastination by providing positive reinforcement for task completion (Steel, 2007). This approach leverages the psychological principle of operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors.

## Key principles of effective reward systems:

1. Immediacy: Rewards should be given as soon as possible after task completion.
2. Proportionality: The reward should be proportional to the effort required for the task.
3. Consistency: Apply the reward system consistently to reinforce the habit.
4. Variety: Use a range of rewards to maintain interest and motivation.
5. Personalization: Choose rewards that are meaningful and motivating to you.

## Types of rewards:

1. Tangible rewards (e.g., small treats, new book, gadget)
2. Activity rewards (e.g., watching a favorite show, playing a game)
3. Social rewards (e.g., sharing accomplishments with friends)
4. Self-care rewards (e.g., taking a relaxing bath, getting a massage)
5. Progress-based rewards (e.g., filling in a progress bar, collecting points)

## Implementation strategies:

1. Create a list of potential rewards that motivate you.
2. Assign specific rewards to different types or sizes of tasks.
3. Use a visual system to track progress and rewards (e.g., a chart or app).
4. Gradually increase the difficulty of tasks required for rewards.
5. Periodically review and adjust your reward system to maintain effectiveness.

## Potential pitfalls to avoid:

1. Choosing rewards that undermine your goals (e.g., unhealthy foods for fitness goals)
2. Setting rewards that are too distant or difficult to achieve
3. Relying solely on external rewards without developing intrinsic motivation

Remember, the goal of a reward system is to build positive associations with task completion and to make the process of overcoming procrastination more enjoyable. As you develop better habits, you may find that the satisfaction of completing tasks becomes a reward in itself.
