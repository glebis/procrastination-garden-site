# Using Productivity Apps and Website Blockers

Leveraging technology through productivity apps and website blockers can be an effective strategy for managing procrastination (Pychyl, 2013). These tools can help create structure, minimize distractions, and increase accountability.

## Types of productivity tools:

1. Task management apps (e.g., Todoist, Asana, Trello)
2. Time tracking apps (e.g., RescueTime, Toggl)
3. Website and app blockers (e.g., Freedom, Cold Turkey, Forest)
4. Focus timers (e.g., Be Focused, Focus@Will)
5. Habit-tracking apps (e.g., Habitica, Streaks)

## Benefits for procrastination management:

- Provide external structure and reminders
- Limit access to distracting websites and applications
- Increase awareness of time usage and productivity patterns
- Gamify productivity and create positive reinforcement

## Implementation strategies:

1. Choose tools that align with your specific procrastination challenges
2. Start with one or two tools and gradually incorporate more as needed
3. Customize settings to fit your work patterns and goals
4. Use blockers during designated focus periods
5. Regularly review your usage and adjust as necessary

## Potential limitations:

- Over-reliance on tools can lead to dependency
- Some individuals may find ways to circumvent blockers
- Not all tools work well for every person or situation

Remember, productivity tools are meant to support your efforts, not replace them. Combine their use with other procrastination management strategies for best results.
